"""Tests for on-demand activation and reactivation in team mode.

Covers:
- _maybe_activate() spawning tasks
- State transitions (available -> working -> available/error)
- Spurious activation handling
- Cancel event clearing
- Reactivation after errors
- On-message callback behavior
- Late-inbox reactivation (message arrives while agent.run() is executing)
