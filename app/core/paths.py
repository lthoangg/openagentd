"""Centralised path helpers for session-scoped on-disk resources.

Single root per session — uploads live *inside* the workspace:

- ``workspace_dir(session_id)`` → ``{OPENAGENTD_WORKSPACE_DIR}/{session_id}``
  Agent workspace — where write/shell tools produce files.  Bounded by
  the sandbox.  Served publicly via the ``/media/`` proxy so the web UI
  can render images the assistant references in markdown.

- ``uploads_dir(session_id)`` → ``{workspace_dir(session_id)}/uploads``
  User-uploaded attachment files (UUID-named, validated at upload).
  Fed to the LLM via curated multimodal rehydration
  (``build_parts_from_metas``) and *also* reachable by the agent's
  filesystem tools as the relative path ``uploads/<filename>``.  This
  is intentional: it lets the agent pass user-uploaded images into
  workspace-bound tools (image/video generation, etc.) without a
  staging step.

  The absolute file path is persisted in the attachment meta dict
  (``att["path"]``) so rehydration is a pure path lookup — no derivation
  from the message's session id.
