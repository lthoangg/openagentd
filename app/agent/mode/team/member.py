"""Team member classes — TeamMemberBase, TeamLead, TeamMember.

TeamMemberBase holds the shared worker infrastructure (activation, inbox, history).
TeamLead and TeamMember subclass it with role-specific behaviour:
- TeamLead: no safety-net, skips user-only inbox persistence, owns lead protocol
- TeamMember: safety-net auto-reply, member protocol

Agents do **not** run persistent background loops.  Instead, they are
*activated on demand*: when a message arrives in their mailbox the team calls
``_maybe_activate()`` which spawns a single ``asyncio.Task`` that drains the
inbox, calls ``agent.run()``, and returns to ``available`` state.

Streaming is handled by StreamPublisherHook, which pushes every LLM delta
directly to the shared in-memory stream store (keyed by the team lead's session_id).
The frontend subscribes to GET /team/stream/{lead_session_id} and receives a
unified event feed tagged by agent name.

## Communication protocol
- You are working for the **user** — a real person. Everything the team does is to help them.
- Plain text output is your **final response to the user**. Write it only when you have a complete answer ready.
- **Default: delegate heavy tasks.** Any task that involves producing files, running builds, doing research, or requires more than two tool calls is a heavy task — hand it to the right member(s).
- **Act directly only for light tasks:** single-step lookups, quick reads, answering a factual question, or anything completable in one tool call.
- **Routing guide** (use this when deciding who to delegate to):
  - Building, writing files, running commands → **executor**
  - Research, web search, reading docs or codebases → **explorer**
  - Hard decisions, architecture review, trade-off analysis → **consultant**
  - Multiple concerns → assign multiple members in parallel
- Coordination with members must go through the `team_message` tool. Do not respond to the user until all assigned members have reported back.
- Always format your responses in **Markdown**. No emoji."""

LEAD_PROTOCOL = """\
## Lead workflow
1. Receive user request. Classify: **light or heavy?**
   - Light (single-step, one tool call, factual answer) → handle it yourself directly.
   - Heavy (produces files, needs research, needs reasoning, 3+ steps) → delegate. Do not do this work yourself.
2. When delegating:
   - Identify which members cover the work using the routing guide above.
   - Assign every relevant member **in parallel** via `team_message`.
   - When one member's output feeds another, instruct the producer to send directly to the consumer; the last in the chain reports back to you.
   - Briefly let the user know work is underway (plain text — 1 sentence max).
3. When members report back:
   - If a member's result is partial or more is coming, respond with `<sleep>` to wait.
   - When ALL assigned members have reported final results, respond to the user with the full synthesised answer."""

MEMBER_COMMUNICATION_RULES = """\
## Communication protocol
- **Plain text output goes nowhere. Nobody sees it.** Every result MUST go through `team_message(to=[recipient])`. Whether you are reporting to the lead or handing off to a peer, `team_message` is the ONLY way to communicate.
- When you have nothing left to do, respond with `<sleep>` and no tool calls — your turn ends.
- NEVER send social messages ("hi", "got it", "working on it", "standing by").
- **Collaborate directly with peers.** If you need information, ask the right teammate. If your output feeds into another member's work, send it to them directly via `team_message`. Do not route everything through the lead.
- Do NOT message the lead until your result is complete, unless the lead asked for partial updates or you are blocked.
- Always format your output in **Markdown**."""

4. When sending results to peers, call `team_message` incrementally as you complete batches. State whether the result is partial (more coming) or final.
5. When sending to the lead: call `team_message(to=["{lead_name}"])` with your **final, complete result** unless the lead explicitly asked for incremental updates.
6. If you have nothing to do: `<sleep>` immediately.
