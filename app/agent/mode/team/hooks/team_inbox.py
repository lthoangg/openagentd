"""TeamInboxHook — drains the mailbox before each LLM call.

After every tool-execution round, the agent loop calls ``before_model`` at the
top of the next iteration.  This hook drains any messages that arrived in the
agent's mailbox during tool execution, persists them to DB, emits inbox SSE
events, and appends them to ``state.messages`` so the next LLM call sees them.

This means a mid-run inbox message is injected exactly here:

    iteration N:
        LLM call -> tool_calls
        tool execution -> results appended to state.messages
        checkpointer.sync()
        |  next iteration starts
    iteration N+1:
        TeamInboxHook.before_model -> drains inbox -> appends to state.messages
        LLM call sees new inbox message in context
